I gathered the data from an open-source platform, conducted data cleaning, and performed data transformation. Additionally, I generated a new attribute as per the specified requirements. Here are the tasks I accomplished:

1. Compared sales and orders using a single chart.
2. Identified the month with the highest sales and orders.
3. Analyzed whether men or women made more purchases in 2023.
4. Identified the different order statuses in 2023.
5. Listed the top 5 states contributing to sales.
6. Investigated the relationship between age and gender based on the number of orders.
7. Determined which channel contributed the most to sales.
